# Industry Security Study Group
Industrial and Embedded Security study group

# Chat group on Zulip
https://issg.zulipchat.com/

# Original intent:

This group grows out of discontentment with regular academic coursework in embedded and industrial cybersecurity and curiosity of the current state-of-the-art in both industry/white hat and the grey hat/black hat ecosystems.

**THIS STUDY GROUP DOES NOT CONDONE ANY ILLEGAL ACTIVITY**

Now that's out of the way, topics that interest me and I'd like to deep-dive into:

- malware analysis (for example stuxnet)

- look into companies that specifically do code review, security analysis, and incident response

- decompilation and dissassembly using tools like ghidra/ida

- open source software security

- embedded device / iot security, hacking canbus

- look into what's involved in the 2026 embedded CTF by MITRE - https://ectf.mitre.org/, or some other public CTF competition
